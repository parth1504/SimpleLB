# Generic Worker Pool with Load Balancing in Go
This Go code provides a compact and generic implementation of a worker pool with load balancing. It efficiently distributes tasks among a dynamic pool of workers. Here's a concise overview of the code:

## Overview
This code represents a flexible worker pool that can handle various types of tasks. You can customize the task execution functions by defining your own task types.

The pool dynamically adjusts its worker count based on incoming workload to optimize resource utilization.

A load balancer intelligently distributes tasks to workers based on their current workload.


The worker pool will dynamically adjust the number of workers based on the incoming workload, ensuring efficient resource utilization. This abstraction allows you to handle various tasks concurrently with automatic load balancing.
