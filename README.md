# Generic Worker Pool with Load Balancing in Go
This Go code provides a compact and generic implementation of a worker pool with load balancing. It efficiently distributes tasks among a dynamic pool of workers. Here's a concise overview of the code:

## Overview
This code represents a flexible worker pool that can handle various types of tasks. You can customize the task execution functions by defining your own task types.

The pool dynamically adjusts its worker count based on incoming workload to optimize resource utilization.

A load balancer intelligently distributes tasks to workers based on their current workload.

## Components
Task Interface:

Defines the interface for tasks. Your custom tasks should satisfy this interface.
Worker Struct:

Represents a worker goroutine.
Executes tasks and reports completion.
Pool Struct:

Maintains a dynamic pool of workers.
Ensures efficient worker allocation and management.
Balancer Struct:

Monitors the worker pool and balances workload among workers.
Dynamically adjusts the worker count based on incoming tasks.
Functions
NewPool(): Initializes a new worker pool with an initial number of workers.

SubmitTask(task Task): Submits a task to the worker pool for execution.

adjustPoolSize(): Dynamically adjusts the worker pool size based on workload.

StartBalancer(): Starts the load balancer to manage task distribution and worker load balancing.

balanceLoad(): Balances workload by assigning tasks to workers with the least load.

Main Function
The main() function demonstrates usage of the worker pool and load balancer. It defines a simple custom task type and submits tasks to the pool.
Usage
## To use this compact worker pool for your specific tasks:

Implement your custom tasks satisfying the Task interface.

Create a Pool instance and start the load balancer using StartBalancer().

Submit tasks to the pool using the SubmitTask() method.

The worker pool will dynamically adjust the number of workers based on the incoming workload, ensuring efficient resource utilization. This abstraction allows you to handle various tasks concurrently with automatic load balancing.
